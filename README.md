# Srinivas Kitchen Website

A visually rich single-page website concept for **Srinivas Kitchen**, an Indian restaurant experience featuring a hero banner, curated menu highlights, gallery, testimonials, and reservation form.

## Tech Stack
- Static HTML5
- Modern CSS with custom gradients and typography
- Vanilla JavaScript for smooth scrolling and dynamic year display

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or
2. Serve the site locally (recommended for best font loading) using any static server. For example:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

## Customization
- Update menu cards inside `index.html` under the `Chef's Specials` section.
- Replace Unsplash image URLs with your own photography when available.
- Adjust theme colors via CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
